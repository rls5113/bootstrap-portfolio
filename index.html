              My passion for programming can be traced back to the time I worked as a field service fax technician for Telautograph/Omnifax.  Before the era of web applications, armed with a Compaq 386 and having no local administrative support, organization of daily tasks were badly needed.  I was able to develop an inventory system to help manage parts usage and reorders, a customer contact list to manage contractually required periodic maintenance, a customer incident worksheet to record details of a service call, and a time reporting system to accomodate biweekly reports for payroll purposes.  
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Having success with these initial programming efforts, motivated to provide for a new family and with the support of my beautiful wife, I was prompted to pursue a future in application programming. Working during the day and attending classes at night, in 1999, I was eventually able to secure an internship with the State of Tennessee, which launched my IT career. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Since that time, providing solutions to the business problem at hand has routinely elevated my excitement levels.  No problem is too small.  An example of a problem I resolved occurred when the query time for a dashboard to return data took longer than acceptable, usually over three minutes.  The dashboard ran more than 12 queries to deliver and display the information and were initially coded to execute sequentially, one after the other.  By splitting up the queries and running in parallel threads, I was able to have the data return in less than three seconds!  It made me extremely happy to deliver a solution that offered a satisfying end user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              With the programming paradigm ever changing and continually improving, I try to keep my skills current with online educational tools, such as Pluralsight.com, Udemy.com, and researching product documentation as needed.  I will occasionally enroll in an instructor led course, for personal interaction and guidance.
            </p>

              Outside interests include golf, home improvement, listening to music, swimming, and enjoying local cuisine.

              Try the LinkedIn or Resume tab for a little more information and the Portfolio tab for examples of a few of the programs I have written.  Only Vandy bootcamp examples are there for now, but expect more in the future.
